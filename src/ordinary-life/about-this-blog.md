# About this blog

## Introduction

Why Am I making this blog? For sharing my insights, write about stuff and show some programming skills. I might write in portuguese, consider that if the post has no indication of the tag `pt-br`, it is in english language.

I wish you would be very pleased to write, here I will write about my own toughts, for now, just expanding the meaning of my ideas:

## Programming

I am currently unemployed and not practicing programming an a professional basis. But I plan to develop my skills in haskell, mainly on functionakl programming and type theory, also some game development stuff.

I am planning to do some educational music games and expand my studies to Demoscene and of course, discuss its subjects.

## Music

I like math rock, playing guitar and accordion, more precisely the open tunings and diatonic button accordion from the southern Brazil are my personal interests!

About music I plan to share some insights and maybe some tips I discovered in my journey!

## Misc

On the useless stuff that make me a better person, it could have some posts about powerlifting or magic practice, but only in a mediocre and hobbyst level. Enjoy!
